# Pytorch-Start
A starter notebook to learn Pytorch. The contents of this notebook are inspired by this awesome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKq-pmkekTk&list=PLlMkM4tgfjnJ3I-dbhO9JTw7gNty6o_2m).
In this notebook, I cover the following topics:
- Creating Tensors
- Creating Models
- Using optimizers
- Datasets and dataloaders
- Creating Linear, Convolutional, RNN models
- Using embedding
